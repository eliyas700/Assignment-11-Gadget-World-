After trying three stores previously & getting not very good customer service over the phone this little beauty Maddison was such a delight to deal with I honestly can’t wait to go into the store because of her. She’s Such an asset to The warehouse. ",

Kim at the Warehouse Whanganui sorted it for us, making a frustrating situation so much easier with her professionalism and persistence. We are so appreciative of the hard work she put in, and her willingness to go the extra mile for us. Give that girl a pay rise!",
